# M0lesto
## Modular Discord bot for A/D CTF competitions
### Description
M0lesto is a Discord bot created during the CyberChallenge 2022 by the team of the "polytechnic of Turin". The purpose of the bot is to alert the team in case of some events, for example when a service loose flags or when a service is down. 
### TO-DO
- Refactoring the code to make it more readable and simple, keep in mind that I developed this tool in a "rush" so the code quality wasn't a concern for me ;)
- Update this readme with more info on how to add different scoreboards for different competitions
- Resolve some minor bugs
